# API based projects


API-based projects are an excellent way to practice integration and modular application design. APIs provide a means to communicate between systems, allowing developers to leverage external services or expose their own. Below are some project ideas focusing on APIs:

## Basic/Intermediate API Projects

#### Weather App Using a Public Weather API:

- **Concept:** Create an app that fetches and displays weather data for a given city.
- **Features:** Current weather, 5-day forecast, temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit), location-based weather using geolocation.
- **Tech:** Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Backend (Node.js/Express or Flask/Django), OpenWeatherMap API or similar.
- **Learning:** API consumption, working with JSON responses, handling HTTP requests.


#### Currency Converter:

- **Concept:** A tool to convert currencies using live exchange rates from an API.
- **Features:** Select source and target currencies, convert based on user input, historical rate tracking.
- **Tech:** Frontend or full-stack with free exchange rate APIs (e.g., Exchangeratesapi.io).
- **Learning:** Working with API endpoints, input validation, presenting dynamic data.

#### Movie Database Search App:

- **Concept:** Allows users to search for movies, view details, and save favorites.
- **Features:** Movie search, detailed view (cast, plot, ratings), save/view favorite movies.
- **Tech:** Use APIs like OMDb or TMDb with frontend frameworks (React, Vue.js) or a backend system.
- **Learning:** Pagination, query parameters, handling API keys securely.
